/* title: MergeSort

   Offers implementation of a stable merge sort algorithm
   with worst case complexity O(n log n).

   When to choose mergesort?:

   If you need a stable algorithm, in cases where you sort
   by one criterion first and after that by another.

   If you know that your data set contains large blocks
   of presorted data, this implementation is very fast,
   meaning O(n) complexity in the best case.

   If additional memory of up to (nr_of_elements * element_size / 2)
   bytes is of no problem.

   But the implementation is much more complex than for example quicksort.
   So if you know your data is random, and do not need a stable algorithm,
   and want to conserve memory, use quicksort.

/* struct: mergesort_t
 * Implementation of a stable mergesort.
 * Sorts the elements in ascending order.
 *
 * Complexity O(n log n).
 *
 * The implementation is an adaption of TimSort.
 * See http://bugs.python.org/file4451/timsort.txt for a description
 * of how the algorithm works.
 *
 * The implementation can use up to (nr_of_elements * elemsize / 2)
 * bytes of additional memory.
 *
 * Description:
 * First the whole array is scanned for presorted slices of the array.
 * Slices with descending order are reversed.
 *
 * If a slice contains less than compute_minslicelen() presorted elements
 * additional elements are added until compute_minslicelen() number of elements
 * are reached. The extended slice is sorted with a stable insertsort.
 *
 * The reference to already scanned and sorted slices are pushed on a stack.
 * The length of the pushed slices must satisfy an invariant.
 * This invariant states that the length of slices forms a Finonacci sequence
 * that is length(n-2) > length(n-1) + length(n) where n is the top of stack.
 * This invariant ensures balanced merges. If the two topmost slices are merged
 * the length of the following slice has at least the size of the two other.
 * Balanced merges are responsible for the log(n) factor in the runtime.
 *
 * The value returned from compute_minslicelen() is chosen between 32 and 64
 * so that the length of the whole array divided by minlen is close to
 * a power of two. This ensures also balanced merges.
 *
 * The stack invariant is established by merging adjacent slices together
 * during the whole array scan.
 *
 * Once the whole array has been scanned all slices on the stack are merged
 * from top to bottom.
